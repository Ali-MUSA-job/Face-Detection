Face Detection (Recognition) Using OpenCV

in this project we used Python(OpenCV) and Pycharm editor.

- To do the faces Recognition we used the (face_recognition) library:
1- First we fetch the images from (dataset/train) file.
2- spilt people names from the photo names.
3- We do the encode for images to use that for recognition.
4- Finally we use the webcam or static video for do the test (recognition).
  
- if you need to use your own dataset for train and test you need just for change content of (dataset) file.
- for train a project with your own photos you need to upload the photos for (dataset/train) file, for test a project with a static videos you need to upload your own videos for (dataset/test).

- Please note, the names of people must be written on the images to be used because the program has been configured to take people names from the names of the images.
